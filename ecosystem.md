# Exhibit A: An ecosystem of products

- re-distribution of responsibilities
- eco-system with pieces coming from different parties

### The current organizing principles around eligibility systems need to change.

We should shift away from single state-based, monolithic (in both the architectural sense and the de facto monolithic nature of dependency on a single locked-in vendor), disconnected, does-everything state systems towards a more interconnected ecosystem of loosely-coupled products, each part with focused responsibility and capable ownership, connected with APIs, creating usable experiences designed around the needs of their users.

The diagram below can be used as a map to explore this piece. The ecosystem described below is in no way complete, but describes whatâ€™s covered in this piece.

**Clients experiences** - Clients apply, submit documents, have visibility into status, notices/notifications, through government and non-government channels - See exhibits:
> - [Exhibit B: Client experiences](#exhibit-b-client-experiences)
> - [Exhibit G: Design systems](#exhibit-g-design-systems)
> - [Exhibit F: Models for building products](#exhibit-f-models-for-building-products)

**Modern data storage** - Source of truth, data coming in from multiple sources, data going out powering multiple products, commodity databases on cloud infrastructure - See exhibits:
> - [Exhibit C: A general model for data collection](#exhibit-c-a-general-model-for-data-collection)
> - [Exhibit F: Models for building products](#exhibit-f-models-for-building-products)

**Worker experiences** - Eligibility workers, managers, and directors have empowering tools that allow them to do their work efficiently and serve their mission - See exhibits:
> - [Exhibit F: Models for building products](#exhibit-f-models-for-building-products)
> - [Exhibit E: State Eligibility & Enrollment App](#exhibit-e-state-eligibility--enrollment-app)

**Eligibility rules services** - Policy is delivered as working code, accommodating state options and avoiding the uncertainty of interpretation and implementation - See exhibit:
> - [Exhibit D: Eligibility rules as a service](#exhibit-d-eligibility-rules-as-a-service)
