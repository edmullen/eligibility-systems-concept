# _Strength 6:_ Legacy systems are steadily transformed through modest increments, continuously delivered to users

Modernizing legacy systems is difficult in the best of circumstances. The government context presents many additional complicating factors. To tap into a more loosely-couple ecosystem, states will need to unwind their legacy systems through a series of incremental improvements.

I delivered a talk at Medicaid Enterprise Systems Conference 2019 entitled [_Reducing Risk and Building Maintainable Systems with Encapsulation_](https://github.com/18F/mesc2019#talk-reducing-risk-and-building-maintainable-systems-with-encapsulation). It discusses what the Encasement Strategy (aka Strangler Fig pattern / Encapsulation) looks like and how it can be used to incrementally transform legacy systems.
