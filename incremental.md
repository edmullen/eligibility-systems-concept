# _Strength 6:_ Legacy systems are steadily transformed through modest increments, continuously delivered to users

Transitioning from a position of weakness to a position of strength will be hard. States will need to unwind their legacy systems to tap into a more loosely-couple ecosystem through a series of incremental improvements.

I delivered a talk at Medicaid Enterprise Systems Conference 2019 entitled [_Reducing Risk and Building Maintainable Systems with Encapsulation_](https://github.com/18F/mesc2019#talk-reducing-risk-and-building-maintainable-systems-with-encapsulation). It discusses what the Encasement strategy (aka Strangler Fig pattern / Encapsulation) looks like and how it can be used to incrementally transform legacy systems.
